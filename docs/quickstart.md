Our first test will be splitted up in 3 obvious steps:
1. Find some window;
2. Find a control inside your window;
3. Do something with control.

Let's examine each step.

**1. Find some window**
The simpliest way is to find a window by it's title. To do this, simply write

    var title = "some title";
    var window = new Window(title);

**2. Find a control inside your window;**

**3. Do something with control.**
